This is a R package to analyze historical cryptocurrency prices and
performance through simple exploratory data analysis including
calculations and plotting. Data is sourced from the KuCoin API. There
are four functions that are included in this R package which are
described in more detail below. Cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts
can use this package to analyze cryptocurrencies of interest.

There are existing R packages that support users to access information
of cryptocurrency such as `crypto`, `crypto2` and `coinmarketcapr`.
Among these 3 packages, only `coinmarketcapr` provides visualization of
top currency. Indeed , there is no integrated R package for retrieving,
analyzing, and visualizing cryptocurrency data altogether. Therefore, we
want to build a simple tool that can facilitate simple cryptocurrency
data analysis all at once.

## Function list

The package contains the following four functions:

-   `retrieve_data`: downloads historical data using an an http request
    from a cryptocurrency exchange.

-   `plot_price`: generates and visualizes a plot of the price of the
    cryptocurrenty inputted over a period of time.

-   `daily_growth_rate`: performs calculation of daily growth rate of
    the price of the cryptocurrency inputted over a period of time.

-   `avg_daily_return`: performs calculation of the average daily return
    of the inputted cryptocurrency price.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `CryptocurrencyEDAr` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/CryptocurrencyEDAr", quiet = TRUE)
```

## Usage

After installation, firstly load the functions from the package:

``` r
devtools::load_all()
#> â„¹ Loading CryptocurrencyEDAr
```

Now the functions are ready to use as follows:

``` r
price_df <- retrieve_data("BTC-USDT", "1day", "2021-01-01", "2021-12-31")
plot_price(df = price_df)
```

``` r
new_price_df <- daily_growth_rate(price_df, "Close")
head(new_price_df)
#>     Symbol       Date   Close daily_growth_rate
#> 1 BTC-USDT 2021-12-30 46216.4                NA
#> 2 BTC-USDT 2021-12-29 47122.4         1.9603431
#> 3 BTC-USDT 2021-12-28 46466.4        -1.3921192
#> 4 BTC-USDT 2021-12-27 47543.8         2.3186647

#> 6 BTC-USDT 2021-12-25 50771.5         0.1100251
avg_daily_return(price_df$Close)
#> [1] -38.65289
